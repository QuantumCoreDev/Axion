# How Axion Elite Works

Axion Elite is a real-world Arduino-powered hardware kit designed to simulate key experiments in quantum physics using light, sensors, and basic optics. Here's how each core module works in practice:

---

## ðŸ”¢ 1. Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)

**Concept:** Uses photonic noise to generate random bits â€” a quantum source of randomness.

**How It Works:**
- A photodiode detects analog variations in ambient or laser light.
- Arduino reads the signal via analog pin and extracts the least significant bit (LSB).
- Bits are concatenated to form binary, decimal, or hex values.

**Outputs:**
- OLED: Shows live bits/values
- Serial Monitor: Streams full entropy pool

## ðŸŒ€ 2. Polarization Explorer

**Concept:** Demonstrates Malusâ€™s Law and polarization effects.

**How It Works:**
- Light passes through two polarizers.
- The second polarizer is mounted on a servo.
- As the servo rotates, the light intensity is read by a photodiode.
- The cosine-square law of intensity vs angle is visualized.

**Outputs:**
- OLED: Angle vs Intensity graph
- Serial: Angle and analog data

## âš¡ 3. Photoelectric Effect Module

**Concept:** Simulates the effect where photons knock out electrons from a metal.

**How It Works:**
- A laser targets a metal plate (simulated with a sensor).
- Photoemission is represented by the analog signal strength (voltage).
- The analog value is proportional to the energy of emitted electrons.

**Outputs:**
- OLED: Displays kinetic energy value
- Serial: Graphs voltage trend

## âœ¨ 4. Machâ€“Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)

**Concept:** Interference through dual paths of light â€” foundational to quantum mechanics.

**How It Works:**
- A laser beam is split using a beamsplitter.
- Each beam reflects off mirrors, then recombines.
- Servo mirrors adjust path difference.
- Interference intensity is read by a photodiode.

**Outputs:**
- OLED: Shows fringe pattern data
- Serial: Light intensity graph vs servo angle
